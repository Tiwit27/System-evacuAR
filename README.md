# 🚨 **evacuAR** - Emergency Evacuation System  

![evacuAR Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tiwit27/System-evacuAR/refs/heads/main/evacuAR_logo_poziome_bez_tla_cien.png)  

**evacuAR** is a next-generation evacuation system designed to save lives by simplifying the process of escaping from buildings during emergencies. It combines technologies like **LiDAR**, **NFC**, and **Augmented Reality (AR)** to offer an intuitive and reliable experience for users and emergency services alike.  

> This project is made for the **National Mechatronics and Electrical Engineering Olympiad**.

## 🎯 **How It Works**  

- **Step 1: Building Mapping**  
   Using LiDAR scanners, a precise 3D model of the building is created and integrated into the app.  

- **Step 2: Route Initialization**  
   Users scan an **NFC tag** or **QR code** to determine their starting position.  

- **Step 3: Real-Time Navigation**  
   The app overlays the safest evacuation path using augmented reality.
